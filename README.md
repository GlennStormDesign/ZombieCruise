## Huh?
I've been making games with code for over three decades, and since 2009, working with C# (in unity). So, while learning C++ (and before that C) has been challenging in the past, since Sept 2019, I've been able to get past major hurdles and get down to it.

The challenge of this project was simple: 32 bytes and 32 hours, make a game. The text adventure format simplified much of the design, and allowed for more focus on optimization of memory, a flexible architecture, etc.

The design idea for this game was taken from an original feature film screenplay concept, which was in turn taken from an old original text adventure game concept. ;)

This is a fairly robust text adventure world (albiet pretty well confined to a small ship) with interactive items, characters and dynamics such as fire. The project ended up taking a little longer than 32 hours (~42), but does indeed only use 32 bytes of working memory.

## Primary Features
* Story and Player Command Parsing
* Inventory and Item Use
* NPCs and Character Dialog
* Combat and Health Management
* Dynamic Environment Elements (fire!)
